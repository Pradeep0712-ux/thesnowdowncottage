                            The Snowdon Cottage is situated in the small Welsh hamlet of Capel Celyn in Snowdonia National Park. Directions and the exact location will be sent to you when you make your booking. This area has a sad history as there used to be a village where the Llyn Celyn reservoir now stands. This village was flooded by Liverpool Authority to provide water for the City. For more information on this history <a href="https://www.nationalwhitewatercentre.co.uk/" target="_blank">Click here</a> . The house is very centrally placed being only 23 miles from Porthmadog and 22 miles from Betws-y-Coed, making it an ideal location if you are looking for tranquillity but require easy reach to Snowdonia’s famous castles and beautiful beaches. Four miles away from the cottage is the renowned Canolfan Tryweryn – The National Whitewater Centre. You can enjoy rafting, kayaking and canoeing.

It is an ideal centre for touring North and Mid-Wales’ Mountains, Valleys and Coasts. Bala is famous for the quality of its watersports facilities, fishing (fly and coarse) walking, cycling and miniature steam railway. It is surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful countryside, being located within the Snowdonia National Park.
